### SQL ASSESSMENT BY ANIL KUMAR*****************

**Sales Performance:**

Kolkata emerges as the top city in terms of total revenue, showcasing its strong contribution to overall sales.
Non-promotional transactions account for a slightly higher total revenue than promotional transactions, indicating that regular purchases may be more significant than promotional sales.

**Customer Behavior:**
\Younger (18-30) and middle-aged (31-45) customers tend to spend more per transaction, indicating higher purchasing power within these age groups. Older customers (60+) exhibit lower spending, which might suggest a need for tailored marketing strategies to boost their engagement.

**Product Trends:**
Laptops are the top-selling product across most cities, highlighting its high demand. This could be leveraged in promotional campaigns to target tech-savvy customers or specific geographic areas.

**Return Rate:**
The return rate is notably high at 49.89%, indicating potential issues with product quality, customer satisfaction, or purchasing decisions. This presents an opportunity for businesses to review product descriptions, improve quality, or adjust their sales strategies to reduce returns.

**Promotions Impact:**
Despite the strong sales numbers from promotional transactions, they do not significantly outperform non-promotional sales, suggesting that promotions may not always drive the expected revenue. Further segmentation and targeting could help in maximizing promotional effectiveness.
